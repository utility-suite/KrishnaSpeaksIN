    description: "Why imbalance, whether through neglect or control, destroys progress, and how balance creates resilience in relationships, leadership, and ambition.",
    tags: ["Balance", "Wisdom", "Life Lessons"],
    content: [
            ` <p class="mb-4">A sitar string is a reminder of life’s greatest discipline. If it is left loose, it produces nothing. If it is pulled too tight, it snaps. Only when tuned with balance does it create music that endures. The same applies to how we approach relationships, ambitions, and responsibilities. Too little care leads to neglect. Too much control leads to suffocation. What sustains harmony is neither extreme but a discipline of balance, applied consciously and consistently.</p>      
              <p class="mb-4">This principle is often overlooked in modern life. We glorify extremes: the unyielding achiever who never rests, or the detached minimalist who abandons responsibility. Both seem admirable in the short term, but both eventually fail. Progress requires attention, but not obsession. Freedom requires space, but not indifference. The test of maturity is not how intensely we hold but how wisely we balance.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Cost of Neglect</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Neglect feels harmless at first because its consequences are invisible. A manager who assumes the team will self-correct discovers missed deadlines. A professional who ignores learning new skills wakes up irrelevant in a fast changing world. A partner who stops investing time finds the relationship quietly losing depth. Like a loose sitar string, nothing breaks immediately, but the silence is unmistakable. Neglect is not absence of harm, it is slow erosion disguised as peace.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Research in organizational behavior confirms this: employees who receive no guidance or feedback report lower motivation and weaker performance compared to those under moderate supervision. Freedom without engagement breeds drift, not innovation. Neglect rarely feels destructive in the present, but it compounds into wasted potential over time.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Trap of Control</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">On the opposite end lies control, often mistaken for care. Parents overprotect in the name of love, but in doing so they stifle resilience. Leaders micromanage in the name of accountability, but they destroy initiative. Even ambition, when clutched too tightly, morphs into obsession that consumes health and joy. Control produces quick compliance but erodes long term strength. Like an overtightened string, the break, when it comes, is sudden and costly.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Psychological studies on autonomy consistently show that people thrive when given structure combined with freedom. Too little freedom and creativity suffocates. Too much freedom and chaos takes over. Balance creates the conditions for trust, innovation, and growth. Control, though it feels safe, always carries the hidden risk of collapse.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Balance as a Practiced Discipline</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Balance is not a static middle point. It is an active discipline. Just as a musician repeatedly tunes the sitar during a performance, we must continuously adjust how we hold life’s strings. At times, responsibilities demand firmer grip. At others, wisdom lies in loosening control. What matters is awareness and adaptability, not rigid formulas.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">In leadership, balance means setting clear expectations while empowering people to decide how to achieve them. In relationships, it means caring deeply while respecting individuality. In ambition, it means striving relentlessly but knowing when to pause and restore. Balance requires humility to step back, courage to let go, and clarity to hold firmly where it matters most.</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>In leadership, guide with clarity but avoid suffocation.</li>
                <li>In relationships, give attention without breeding dependence.</li>
                <li>In ambition, pursue excellence without sacrificing well being.</li>
                <li>In self growth, practice consistency without rigidity.</li>
                <li>Measure success not by intensity of effort but by sustainability of progress.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thought</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">The sitar does not play itself. Its music is the outcome of disciplined balance, again and again. The same is true for life. Neither neglect nor control can sustain harmony. What creates resonance is the wisdom to tighten just enough, loosen just enough, and trust the note when it is right. Balance is not weakness, nor compromise. It is mastery, the discipline of those who know that strength is not in extremes, but in harmony sustained over time.</p>

    description: "Why abundance without discipline leads to waste, regret, and distraction, and how moderation brings clarity and progress.",
    tags: ["Self Awareness", "Life Lessons", "Discipline"],
    content: [
            ` <p class="mb-4">Excess feels like a blessing at first. It promises freedom, ease, and joy. Yet often it turns into a trap. When there is too much, we stop valuing, we stop planning, and we lose the sharpness that comes with scarcity. What begins as comfort slips into carelessness, and carelessness always leads to regret. Life shows us again and again that anything in excess, whether wealth, comfort, or even food, dulls the discipline that scarcity once sharpened.</p>      
              <p class="mb-4">Think back to the days when mobile data in India was expensive. A single gigabyte cost around ₹150 (INR). Every MB mattered. People planned their usage carefully. They decided what to download, what to watch, and what to skip. There was clarity and intention in every choice. Then came the shift, when the same ₹150 (INR) offered one full gigabyte every day for a month. Suddenly, planning disappeared. People streamed endlessly, scrolled without purpose, and spent hours lost in distraction. What once sharpened priorities slowly gave way to careless consumption. Abundance became the breeding ground of distraction.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Hidden Cost of Abundance</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">When resources are abundant, discipline often disappears. The human mind loves shortcuts. If something feels unlimited, we stop valuing it. But nothing in life is truly unlimited. Time is limited. Energy is limited. Attention is limited. These are the currencies that actually shape our lives. When abundance dulls our sense of value, we waste the only things that truly matter. A bank account can be refilled, but wasted years cannot be recovered. This is the cost we rarely calculate until it is too late.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Scarcity Sharpens, Excess Weakens</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Scarcity, though uncomfortable, forces clarity. It makes you choose wisely. It pushes you to focus. It sharpens creativity because you have to do more with less. Think of a student with only two hours of internet access in a library. The focus in those two hours is unmatched. Now compare that with someone who has endless access at home. The very abundance of hours becomes an excuse to waste them. What feels like freedom is actually chains disguised as luxury. Without limits, abundance erodes character.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Learning to Use, Not Abuse</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">The answer is not to run from abundance but to learn to handle it with maturity. Having more does not mean consuming more. It means choosing better. It means setting boundaries even when no one forces you to. It means remembering that just because something is available does not make it valuable. The abundance of information has not made us wiser. In many cases, it has only made us more distracted. The same abundance, when handled with discipline, can make us powerful. The difference lies not in what we have, but in how we use it.</p> 
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Plan your resources, even if they feel unlimited.</li>
                <li>Value your time more than your conveniences.</li>
                <li>Resist the urge to consume simply because you can.</li>
                <li>Turn abundance into opportunity, not distraction.</li>
                <li>Remember that true freedom is the ability to say no, not just the chance to say yes.</li>
              </ul> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thought</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Excess is not freedom. It is a test. Those who fail get consumed by it. Those who master it turn abundance into growth. Discipline in abundance is harder than discipline in scarcity, but it is the only way to avoid regret and to live with clarity. Freedom is not found in endless choices, but in the wisdom to make the right ones, even when everything is available.</p>

    tags: ["Self Awareness", "Life Skills", "Decision Making"],
    content: [
            ` <p class="mb-4">Many people confuse passions with hobbies, but they are not the same. The difference is subtle on the surface, yet critical when it comes to how they shape your life. A hobby can be put down and picked up whenever you like. Passion does not give you that luxury. It haunts you, fuels you, and sometimes even exhausts you.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Makes a Hobby?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">A hobby is something you do for relaxation, enjoyment, or distraction. Reading novels, gardening, painting on weekends, or playing guitar after work. These bring peace and creativity without the weight of obligation. You can set them aside for weeks or months and return to them unchanged. A hobby adds flavor to life, but it does not define who you are.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Makes a Passion?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Passion is a different beast. It does not wait politely for your free time. It demands your attention. Passions do not merely relax you. They drive you forward, sometimes to the edge of madness. They soothe you while simultaneously refusing to let you rest. Writing, building businesses, chasing a cause, or solving problems. These are not just things you do, they become things you cannot imagine your life without.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Critical Difference</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">The real line between hobby and passion is intensity. A hobby is leisure. A passion is identity. A hobby might fill your evenings, but a passion can reshape your future. Hobbies cost little. Passions demand sacrifice. They ask for your time, your energy, and sometimes your comfort. That is why pursuing a passion feels both rewarding and painful at the same time.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why It Matters</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Clarity matters because it sets expectations. If something is a hobby, let it remain a place of joy and rest. But if it is a passion, you must be ready for the weight it carries. Passions bring frustration, sacrifice, and discipline, but also fulfillment, impact, and meaning. They are the things worth suffering for.</p> 
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>If it relaxes you and you can pause it, it is a hobby.</li>
                <li>If it will not leave you alone, it is a passion.</li>
                <li>Hobbies enrich life. Passions can define it.</li>
              </ul> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thought</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Not everything you enjoy needs to become a passion. And not every passion is meant to be a career. But if something keeps tugging at you, driving you restless until you return to it, respect that pull. That is no longer a hobby. That is your passion, and it is worth following wherever it leads.</p>

    title: "The Joy of Being Alone Before Choosing Togetherness",
    description: "Why most relationships collapse into misery, and how learning to be content alone is the only antidote.",
    tags: ["Self Awareness", "Relationships", "Life Lessons"],
    content: [
            ` <p class="mb-4">There is a rare kind of joy that comes when you are at ease with your own company. It is calm, light, and freeing. You do not wait for someone else to make you feel whole. You do not cling to the presence of another to escape the silence. Instead, the silence itself becomes your companion, and in that quiet, you find peace.</p> 
              <p class="mb-4">But here is the bitter truth most avoid: people rush into relationships not from strength but from weakness. Not out of joy, but out of fear. They are terrified of being alone. They think a partner will patch their emptiness, and in that illusion they tie themselves to another who is thinking the exact same way. It is a disaster in the making.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Harsh Reality of Fear-Based Bonds</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">When two incomplete people come together, the relationship is doomed from the start. Each is waiting to be filled, but neither has anything to give. This is not love. It is begging. <strong>Beggars begging to each other, both with empty bowls</strong>, hoping the other will provide. And as time passes, frustration replaces affection, expectations turn into accusations, and joy turns into misery. This is why so many relationships rot over the years.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Contrast: When Joy Meets Joy</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Now compare that with two people who are already full on their own. They have mastered the art of being alone. They do not depend on each other for survival of the soul. When they come together, it is not to beg but to share. They scatter their joy freely. Their bond is not a desperate escape from loneliness, but a conscious choice to walk together. And because of that, it is light, effortless, and alive.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Most People Fail</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">The world keeps selling the lie that you need someone to complete you. Movies, books, even society glorify this dependence. And so people enter relationships carrying wounds, fears, and emptiness, expecting their partner to be the healer, the savior, the source of joy. It is unfair and it is cruel. No partner can carry that burden forever. That is why the same people who once claimed they were in love end up bitter, resentful, and broken.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Only Way Out</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Learn to be alone first. Learn to smile without anyone beside you. Learn to enjoy your evenings, your silences, your thoughts. When you no longer feel restless in solitude, you have mastered yourself. Only then should you step into a relationship, not as a beggar seeking scraps of happiness, but as a giver who multiplies joy.</p> 
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Spend time with yourself without distraction until silence stops feeling like punishment.</li>
                <li>Build passions and routines that bring you genuine happiness on your own.</li>
                <li>Face your loneliness directly instead of masking it with people.</li>
                <li>Make peace with the fact that no one else is responsible for your joy.</li>
              </ul> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thought</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">If you cannot stand your own company, you have no business dragging another into your emptiness. First fill yourself. Then, if love comes, it is a choice, not a crutch. And if it does not, you remain unshaken. That is freedom. That is strength. That is the only way relationships can survive without collapsing into misery.</p>

    title: 'Why Success Stories Always Sound So Relatable',
    description: `Ever wondered why great success stories often begin with tales of struggle? It's not always reality, it’s about creating association, relatability, and inspiration.`,
    tags: ["Success", "Inspiration", "Life Lessons", "Storytelling"],
    content: [
            ` <p class="mb-4">If you want to truly impact the lives of others, people first need to feel connected to you. And connection doesn’t happen in the extraordinary, it happens in the ordinary. Association is built when we see parts of ourselves in someone else. That’s why most powerful stories of success are told in a way that makes them sound relatable, familiar, and almost mirror-like to the lives of those listening.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Look closely at the stories of the greats we admire. More often than not, they’re painted against a backdrop of struggle: humble beginnings, sleepless nights, a battle against odds. But here’s the twist: not every successful person was on the brink of begging, nor did each one rise from absolute poverty. Yet their stories are often framed that way. Why? Because relatability is the bridge between admiration and inspiration.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Psychology of Relatability</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Humans are wired to associate. We lean toward people who share our struggles, values, or lived experiences. When someone’s journey feels like ours, we’re more likely to believe that we too can achieve what they have. It’s not about facts alone, it’s about resonance.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">That’s why the narrative of “ordinary beginnings” is powerful. It assures the middle-class worker, the struggling student, or the dreamer with limited resources that greatness is not out of reach. Stories are shaped not just to inform, but to connect. And connection always precedes inspiration.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">But Is It Always True?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Not exactly. Some leaders, innovators, and creators were never on the verge of desperation. They may have had supportive families, stable opportunities, or smoother starts. Yet when their journeys are shared, the lens often focuses on the struggles rather than the privileges. Why? Because the raw struggle narrative creates an emotional entry point. Without it, their story risks sounding distant, almost unattainable.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">It’s less about fabrication and more about emphasis. Every life has hurdles, but the ones that echo with the masses are the ones highlighted. It’s storytelling with intention.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Example: The Crafted Narrative</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Think about motivational speeches. Rarely do you hear a speaker say, “I had all the resources, my path was smooth, and I never had to worry.” Instead, you’ll hear about the tough days, the failures, the near collapses. Why? Because audiences don’t associate with ease, they associate with effort. Struggle humanizes success. Without it, achievement feels cold and unrelatable.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">So, What’s the Lesson?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">If you want to influence or inspire, it’s not enough to showcase success. You must allow people to see the parts of your story that overlap with theirs. Share your doubts, your mistakes, your detours, not just your victories. Because impact doesn’t come from standing on a pedestal; it comes from sitting beside someone and saying, “I’ve been there too.”</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thought</h4>
              <p class="mb-4"'>Greatness rarely begins with greatness. It begins with being relatable, with showing that the extraordinary is often built upon the ordinary. That’s why the legends we admire are framed as once being like us, because only then can their rise feel possible for us too.</p>

    description: 'Explore the subtle shift when your decisions stop being truly yours, and how to reclaim your rational freedom in a world full of expectations.',
    tags: ['Decision Making', 'Self Awareness', 'Life Lessons'],
    content: [
            ` <p class="mb-4">There’s a rare kind of power when your decisions come straight from you: bold, fearless, and unfiltered. Think back to a time when you chose a path simply because it felt right to you, not because anyone else said it should. Maybe it was picking a college, chasing a passion, or making a life-changing move. That’s pure freedom. It’s electric. It’s yours alone.</p> 
              <p class="mb-4">But then life changes the game. The world starts watching. Your choices become performances, and suddenly, approval isn’t just welcome, it feels essential. That applause? It’s addictive. Yet, with every cheer, your decisions begin to shift. What once was fierce and authentic softens and bends to expectations.</p> 
              <p class="mb-4">Before you know it, your choices aren’t truly yours anymore. They’re shaped by what others want to see or hear. The freedom you once held tight quietly slips away, replaced by a need to fit in, to avoid conflict, to earn acceptance.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Example 1: The Passion Put on Hold</h4> 
              <p class="mb-4">Imagine loving something fiercely; maybe painting, music, or a hobby that makes your heart race. But over time, you shelve it because “there’s no time,” “it’s not practical,” or “people don’t take it seriously.” Instead, you pour energy into what’s expected: stability, a conventional routine. That passion? It doesn’t vanish; it quietly waits, while your choices revolve around what others deem sensible.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Example 2: The Social Media Shift</h4> 
              <p class="mb-4">You started sharing your honest thoughts and interests online; raw, unfiltered, real. But as followers and likes mounted, you found yourself tailoring your posts to what’s trendy, what’s expected, what gets the most engagement. That authentic voice? It slowly fades into a curated persona designed to win approval.</p> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Does This Happen?</h4> 
              <p class="mb-4">Because humans are wired for connection and acceptance. The desire to belong is powerful. But when approval becomes the compass, our own inner voice gets drowned out, and decisions lose their clarity and courage.</p> 
              <p class="mb-4">So when you feel your freedom slipping away, pause and ask yourself:</p> 
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> 
                <li>Am I making this choice because it resonates deeply with me, or because it will make others happy?</li> 
                <li>Is this decision aligned with my long-term goals, or is it a quick fix to avoid discomfort?</li> 
                <li>If no one were watching, what would I truly want to choose?</li> 
              </ul> 
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How to Take Back Your Freedom</h4> 
              <p class="mb-4">Reclaiming decision freedom doesn’t mean shutting out advice or isolating yourself. It means grounding your choices in your authentic self first, then welcoming outside perspectives without losing your voice.</p> 
              <p class="mb-4">Try this simple exercise to reconnect with your true compass:</p> 
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4"> 
                <li>Write down the decision you’re facing.</li> 
                <li>List who’s influencing you and why.</li> 
                <li>Separate your own reasons from external pressures.</li> 
                <li>Circle what feels most genuine and true to you.</li> 
              </ul> <p class="mb-4">Decisions born from your own truth carry strength, clarity, and peace. Approval from others? It’s a bonus, not the foundation.</p>

    title: '"Pause Before You Decide" - A Thoughtful Guide to Better Decisions',
    description: 'A practical, expressive guide on how to make mindful decisions by checking legality, balance, fairness, emotional impact, and long-term value.',
    tags: ['Decision Making', 'Life Skills', 'Self Growth'],

            ` <p class="mb-4">In our fast-paced world, decisions often come flying at us like arrows; some small, like what to eat for dinner, and others life-altering, like switching careers, ending a relationship, or moving cities. While it’s tempting to react instantly, <strong>the true strength lies in the pause</strong>; a moment to reflect and ask yourself: <em>“Is this really the right step?”</em></p>
              <p class="mb-4">At <strong>Krishna Speaks IN</strong>, we believe that mindful decision-making isn’t just a skill but it’s a lifestyle choice. Whether you’re navigating personal challenges or professional dilemmas, consider this powerful checklist to guide your choices:</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Is It Legal?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Let’s start with the obvious. No matter how tempting the shortcut or how urgent the need, <strong>if it breaks the law, it breaks you</strong> in the long run. Think of legal boundaries as the non-negotiable foundation. You don’t want your decision to turn into a courtroom drama later.</p>
              <p class="mb-4"><strong>Example:</strong> Say you’re building your personal blog. Using copyrighted content without credit or permission might seem harmless at first. But in the long run, it could land you into legal trouble and ruin your credibility. Stick with originality or proper attribution: it’s not only legal, it’s ethical.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Is It Balanced?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">A decision shouldn't throw your life off the axis. Balance means ensuring that <strong>your health, time, relationships, and energy</strong> aren't being sacrificed completely for one aspect; be it money, work, or ambition.</p>
              <p class="mb-4"><strong>Real-life flash:</strong> If you're planning to start a side hustle while working a full-time job, ask: <em>Will this burn me out? Will I still have time for my family, sleep, or a Sunday break?</em> If the answer is no, it’s time to reassess.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Is It Fair?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Fairness goes beyond what benefits <em>you</em>and it considers how your decision affects others involved. Is your choice trampling on someone else’s peace, opportunity, or growth?</p>
              <p class="mb-4"><strong>Think of this:</strong> You get an offer to jump ship from your current job right after your teammate trained you for a big collaborative project. Taking the offer might seem smart, but fairness asks: <em>Am I being just to my team, my responsibilities, my word?</em></p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Is It a Win-Win?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">The best decisions don’t leave losers behind. A win-win outcome benefits you <em>and</em> others, creating lasting partnerships and mutual respect. If your decision makes someone else lose face, money, or dignity; it might not be the right call.</p>
              <p class="mb-4"><strong>Example:</strong> As the founder of <strong>Krishna Speaks IN</strong>, imagine collaborating with a fellow blogger. You both want visibility. Instead of competing, you co-author a post; doubling your reach, combining wisdom, and gaining each other’s audience. That’s a win-win.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Feeling Check - What Do You Feel, and What Will Your Family Feel?</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Gut feelings matter. But so do the hearts of the people who love you. If a decision fills you with guilt, fear, or unease, pay attention. Ask yourself:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Would I be proud sharing this with my parents or partner?</li>
                <li>How will they feel if I go through with this?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mb-4"><strong>Picture this:</strong> You're offered a job abroad with double the pay. Exciting, right? But your ailing parents depend on your presence, your child needs your guidance, and you know you’ll miss key years of togetherness. In such moments, <em>feelings carry more truth than numbers ever will</em>.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Always Think Long-Term - Look at the Bigger Picture</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Sometimes the short-term gain clouds the long-term cost. But <strong>time reveals all truths</strong>. Think five years ahead:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Will this decision still make sense?</li>
                <li>Is it sustainable, or is it just a shiny distraction?</li>
                <li>Does it contribute to the life you're building?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mb-4">At <strong>Krishna Speaks IN</strong>, we say: zoom out before you zoom in. Whether it's accepting a business deal or saying yes to a new relationship, think about <em>where it leads</em>.</p>
              <h4 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Final Thoughts</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">Decisions are the bricks that build your future. Each one either small or large; adds to your story. Use this 5-point checklist like your personal compass:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Legal?</li>
                <li>Balanced?</li>
                <li>Fair?</li>
                <li>Win-win?</li>
                <li>Feel right to you and your loved ones?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mb-4">Because at the end of the day, a good decision doesn’t just work out; it <em>feels right, fits right, and lives right</em>.</p>
              <p class="mt-6">Stay thoughtful. Stay grounded. - <em>Krishna from KrishnaSpeaksIN</em></p> `

                <p>रात भर सोचता रहा,<br />
                अपने को कोसता रहा।<br />
                काश की होती पढ़ाई, तो<br />
                होती आज मोटी कमाई।</p>
                <br />
                <p>गुजरा हुआ जो कल था,<br />
                चुभ रहा उस पल था।<br />
                एक प्रश्न था जेहन में, जो प्रायः<br />
                होता है हर गरीब के मन में,<br />
                क्या करूँ क्या ना करूँ,<br />
                अब जिन्दा रहूँ या मरुँ।</p>
                <br />
                <p>जिंदगी सस्ती सी लगती थी, क्यूँकि<br />
                मेरा जीवन एक डूबती हुई कश्ती थी।<br />
                फिर भी मन में थी एक आस, क्यूँकि<br />
                मुझे अपनी काबिलियत पर था विश्वास।</p>
                <br />
                <p>आज नहीं तो कल सही,<br />
                मिलेगी तो मंजिल है ही।<br />
                यही सोचकर मैं चलता रहा,<br />
                रात-दिन गिनता रहा।<br />
                आखिर आ गया वह समय था, जिसके लिए<br />
                हर दिन मर-मर कर जिया मैं था।</p>
                <br />
                <p>यह एक खूबसूरत एहसास था,<br />
                जो चाहो वह अपने पास था।<br />
                रूपया था, पैसा था,<br />
                घर भी जन्नत जैसा था।</p>
                <br />
                <p>फिर भी एक चीज की कमी थी,<br />
                वह चीज "सुकून की घड़ी" थी।<br />
                मानों वह बर्फ सी जमी थी,<br />
                शायद अंदर आग की कमी थी।</p>
                <br />
                <p>जिसको पाने की तमन्ना में, अमीर<br />
                गरीब एक तल पर आ जाएँ,<br />
                जिसके मिलने से मानो सब मिल जाये,<br />
                वह सुकून पैसे-रुपयों से कैसे खरीदा जाए?</p>
