            "<p>The city outside was noisy, impatient, and restless, but the restaurant we stepped into felt like a different world. Afternoon sunlight streamed through tall glass panes, softened by sheer curtains that swayed gently in the air-conditioning. The tables gleamed with polished wood, crystal glasses sparkled like ornaments, and the cutlery lay in its place as though rehearsed for a photograph. Conversations rose and fell in polite tones, the sound carrying just enough to remind you that you were never alone, yet never intruded upon.</p>",
            "<p>We were guided to our table, half of it lined with elegant chairs, the other half with a long cushioned sofa. My friends, without hesitation, slipped into the chairs, adjusting themselves with the formality one associates with fine dining. I lingered for a moment, glancing at the sofa. It was inviting, soft, almost whispering of home rather than ceremony.</p>",
            "<p>And so I chose differently.</p>",
            "<p>I set my sandals aside, climbed onto the sofa, and folded my legs beneath me. For a moment, I wondered if it might look odd here, among pressed shirts and polished shoes. But the thought quickly gave way to comfort. The cushion held me gently, the plate before me suddenly felt closer, more mine. It was not the seating of etiquette, but it was the seating of ease.</p>",
            "<p>The food arrived, plates steaming, aromas swirling upward, sauces glistening under the light. We began to eat, laughter rolling around the table in easy bursts. I was halfway through my plate when I felt a gentle tap on my arm.</p>",
            "<p>“Look there,” my friend whispered, tilting his head toward another corner.</p>",
            "<p>I turned. Two young women sat finishing their lunch. I had noticed them briefly when we entered, both upright, their backs straight, the kind of posture that seems stitched into the fabric of dining in elegant places. But now, something had changed.</p>",
            "<p>One of them had tucked her legs onto the sofa, folded neatly, mirroring my own posture. Her body looked freer, her face a little brighter, as though she had discovered a small rebellion that felt entirely her own. Her friend, still sitting the conventional way, laughed at her sudden shift.</p>",
            "<p>“When did you decide to sit like that? And why?” she asked.</p>",
            "<p>The girl smiled, half shrugging, and tilted her head in my direction. The gesture said what words didn’t need to: If he can sit like that and enjoy his meal, why can’t I?</p>",
            "<p>For a moment, I sat frozen, not out of embarrassment, but out of quiet wonder. I hadn’t spoken to her, hadn’t tried to influence anyone. I had only chosen what felt natural to me. Yet that simple act had rippled outward and given a stranger the freedom to do the same.</p>",
            "<p>And it struck me then: influence is not always born in speeches, books, or stages. Sometimes, it is born in the smallest choices we make, the little ways we are unafraid to be ourselves.</p>",
            "<p>As I continued eating, a thought lingered. How many times in life do we hesitate, worrying about appearances, rules, and invisible eyes watching us? And how often do we forget that by being authentic, we might be offering someone else the courage they didn’t know they needed?</p>",
            "<p>That afternoon, in the glow of the restaurant, amidst crystal glasses and soft chatter, I learned that even a seating posture could carry meaning. My comfort became her comfort. My decision to sit my way became her permission to do the same.</p>",
            "<p>The grandeur of the place, the etiquette of posture, the silent codes of refinement, they all dissolved in that realization. What remained was a simple truth: the real joy is not in how perfectly you fit into the setting, but in how fully you savor the moment.</p>",
            "<p>So now I remind myself: never hold back from being genuine. You never know who is watching, who is quietly waiting for a sign, who is ready to follow your lead into their own small freedom.</p>",
            "<p>That day, all I did was sit cross-legged on a sofa. Yet for someone else, it was enough to change how they enjoyed their meal.</p>"
