      <p class="mb-3">
        <strong>Driven by curiosity, defined by impact.</strong> I am <strong>Krishna Kumar Pandey</strong>, currently serving as a 
        <strong>Technical Assistant</strong> at the <strong>Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru</strong>, where I contribute 
        to research-focused initiatives, streamline operations, and ensure the seamless functioning of high-performance environments. 
        My journey has been shaped by a desire to learn, lead, and create meaningful change.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        I hold a <strong>Master’s in Computer Applications (MCA)</strong> from <strong>JAIN (Deemed-to-be University), Bengaluru</strong>, graduating 
        with distinction, and a <strong>Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA)</strong> from 
        <strong>Acharya Institute of Graduate Studies, Bengaluru</strong>. These years not only defined my academic journey but 
        also helped me develop leadership, organizational, and creative skills. I was honored with the 
        <strong>Best Outgoing Student Award</strong> and the <strong>Acharya Meritorious Student Award</strong> for my contributions and excellence.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Beyond my professional role, I thrive on leading and inspiring others. As <strong>Coordinator of the TechnoZeal Club (TechMindz)</strong>, 
        I organized sessions on problem-solving and career preparation, while my editorial and organizational work with the 
        <strong>Hindi Club</strong> and its magazine <strong>“Reyansh”</strong> allowed me to explore creativity and storytelling. Leading 
        the <strong>Celebrate Together Club</strong> further strengthened my ability to foster collaboration and inclusivity.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Over time, I have also achieved milestones like qualifying <strong>GATE (CS) 2023</strong> and <strong>UGC NET (December 2022 & June 2024)</strong>. 
        I firmly believe that success is measured not just by personal achievements but by the impact we create for others. 
        This website reflects my journey, values, and vision - a pursuit to keep learning, evolving, and making a difference.
