      Every journey carries a story, and this space brings together the chapters that shaped mine. What began as a simple interest in technology grew into a deep fascination for learning, and ultimately an urge to share ideas that bring genuine value to others.

      My path led me to the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, where I serve as a Technical Assistant, contributing to research initiatives and developing solutions that simplify complex challenges and support meaningful progress.

      With a strong foundation in computer applications and milestones such as clearing GATE and NET, I continue to explore, experiment, and grow. This platform reflects that journey, offering insights and experiences gathered along the way.
